Ropt Design
===========

There are a few goals of Ropt.  First and foremost, Ropt aims to provide a
simple way of interacting with REST APIs in a configurable manner. The goal is
a tool which uses configuration files to translate command line input into
HTTP requests to REST API endpoints, and to provide usage strings for those
endpoints.
